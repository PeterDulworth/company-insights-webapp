# Company Insight Utility
#### Built by Peter Dulworth for Nesh

### Installation
Note: I developed this application for Google Chrome. Most testing has been done with Chrome 72.0.3626.109.

### Running
#### Front End
```bash
npm install
```
```bash
npm start
```

#### Back End
```bash
python app.py
```

This will launch the backend at http://localhost:5000

To test calls to the backend without the front-end you can open
terminal and run.

```
curl -i http://localhost:5000/symbol/oxy
```
`oxy` can be substituted for any symbol.
